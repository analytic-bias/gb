## Frege’s Logicist Dream.

Frege’s *Begriffsschrift*, or conceptual ideography, was a partial
fulfillment of Leibniz’s dream of a universal logical language in which
philosophical and mathematical concepts could be expressed with great
precisions. Once this language was discovered, Leibniz envisions,
answers to philosophical questions could be resolved, as in mathematics,
by a *calculus philosophicus* or *ratiocinator*. Unlike his predecessors
such Boole and Schröder who used mathematical symbols and fo*r*mulae to
calculate logical relations, Frege’s goal was more radical: to construct
a fundamentally new and more powerful *symbolic logic* that could serve
as the *foundation* for mathematics.

Frege dreamed of constructing the logical foundations for arithmetic.
This dream was known as *logicism*, which can be expressed as the
following thesis:

Arithmetic = Logic + Set Theory.

To fulfill this dream Frege realized he had to discover, or create, a
more powerful conception of logic than Aristotle and to create a more
rigorous concept of proof than Boole. Frege’s *Begriffsschrift* \[1879\]
is now regarded as the “founding document” of modern logic.[2] Jean van
Heijenoort who edited, and set a high standards for scholarship in
logic, wrote the following in his classic resource book in mathematical
logic *From Frege to Gödel*:

> This is the first work that Frege wrote in the field of logic, and,
> although a mere booklet of eighty-eight pages, it is perhaps the most
> important single work ever written in logic. Its fundamental
> contributions, among lesser points, are the truth-functional
> propositional calculus, the analysis of the proposition into function
> and argument(s) instead of subject and predicate, the theory of
> quantification, a system of logic in which derivations are carried out
> exclusively according to the form of the expressions, and a logical
> definition of the notion of mathematical sequence. Any single one of
> these achievements would suffice to secure the book a permanent place
> in the logician's library.

Frege compared his *Begriffsschrift* to a microscope (fittingly, Frege’s
research was anonymously supported by a company that made precision
optical equipment):

I believe that I can best make the relation of my ideography
\[*Begriffsschrift*\] to ordinary language clear if I compare it to that
which the microscope has to the eye. Because of the range of its
possible uses and versatility with which it can adapt to the most
diverse circumstances, the eye is far superior to the microscope....
But, as soon as scientific goals demand great sharpness of resolution,
the eye proves to be insufficient. The microscope, on the other hand, is
perfectly suited to precisely such goals....

Like a microscope, Frege’s *Begriffsschrift* would resolve philosophical
confusions with the clarity of logical precision:

If it is one of the tasks of philosophy to break the domination of the
word over the human spirit by laying bare the misconceptions that
through the use of language often almost unavoidably arise concerning
the relations between concepts and by freeing thought from that with
which only the means of expression of ordinary language, constituted as
they are, saddle it, then my Concept Script, further developed for these
purposes, can become a useful tool for the philosopher.

Frege’s discovery was that a new and more comprehensive logic could be
based, not on the *subject* and *predicate* distinction of Aristotelian
logic, but on the mathematical notion of *function* and *argument*.
Frege predicted, “In particular, I believe that the replacement of the
concepts of *subject* and *predicate* by *argument* and *function*,
respectively, will stand the test of time.”

<img src="./attachments/$myfilename/media/image1.png"
style="width:1.67986in;height:1.4625in" alt="begriffschrift" />The
reception of Frege’s work was hindered by the forbidding nature of his
notation. Russell in his preface to *The Philosophy of Mathematics* said
he had seen Frege’s *Grundgesetze der Arithmetik* \[vol. 1, 1893\] but
admitted that he had “failed to grasp its importance or to understand
its contents” because of “the great difficulty of his symbolism” \[p.
xvi\]. A sample of Frege’s notation is displayed (*right*).[3]

Frege’s writings contain two conceptions of generality.In his
*Begrifftsschrift*, Frege explained the notion of generality \[*Die
Allgemeinheit*\] *semantically* by stating that each instance of a
generality is a fact, but later added the “illuminating” observation
that generality can be inferred from *provability* from an arbitrary
instance. Translating his notation into modern symbols, Frege had
formulated the rule:[4]

> It is even illuminating that one can derive P → ∀*x*F*x* from P →
> F*a*, if P is an expression in which *a* does not occur and if *a*
> stands in F*a* only in argument places.

These two notions of generality correspond to the *semantics* for
universal quantification (UI) and the syntactical inference rule of
universal generalization (UG) or, alternatively, the derivation form
known as universal derivation (UD). In his *Grundgesetze der
Arithmetik*, Frege introduced quantification as a *second-order
concept*—or as a concept of concepts.

Frege believed that “Every good mathematician is at least half a
philosopher, and every good philosopher is at least half a
mathematician.”[5] Here Frege’s relatively half-hearted, and reserved,
claim can be constrained with Leibniz’s full-throated proclamation:
“Without mathematics we cannot penetrate deeply into philosophy. Without
philosophy we cannot penetrate deeply into mathematics. Without both we
cannot penetrate deeply into anything.”[6]

As a philosopher of language, Frege’s work set much of the agenda of
20<sup>th</sup> century analytic philosophy.[7] As a logician and
mathematician, Frege set a standard of rigor[8] that was not equaled in
Russell and Whitehead’s *Principia Mathematica* \[1910 – 1913\]. In
Quine’s (1908 – 2000) famous assessment: “Logic is an old subject, and
since 1879 has been a great one.”

In this chapter, we want to get some sense of the grandeur of Frege’s
vision, how Frege’s more power symbolic logic was able to subsume
earlier developments of logic such as Aristotle’s syllogism and Boole’s
algebra of logic, and how Frege’s ill-fated conception of sets (or
“courses of values”) licensed the fatal derivation of Russell’s paradox
leading Frege to dred that his life’s work had been a star-crossed
dream.

## Fregean versus Cantorian Set Theory.

How does Fregean set theory d*iffer from Cantorian set theory? First
let’s state a principle upon which both conceptions agree, namely, the
axiom* *of* *extensionality*, which states that set identity depends
only on membership.

*Axiom of Extensionality.* Sets are identical if (and only if) they have
the same members:

*x* = *y* ↔ ∀*z*(*z* ∈ *x* ↔ *z* ∈ *y*) ,

where the e*x*pression ‘*x* ∈ *y*’ is read ‘*x* is a member of *y*’.
(The *“only if”* part of the biconditional follows by the logic of
identity.)

The second axiom of sets, known as the *Naïve Comprehension* *axiom*,
distinguishes Fregean from Cantorian set theory. Given a formal logical
language in which ϕ(*x*) is a well-formed formula containing the free
variable *x,* then there exists a set

{*x*|ϕ(*x*)} ,

consisting of the objects which have the property expressed by ϕ(*x*).
The e*x*pression ‘{*x*|ϕ(*x*)}’ is read ‘the set of all *x* such that
ϕ(*x*)’.

The axiom is denigrated as “naïve” insofar it now seems obvious that
treating sets as *extensions* of concepts leads to contradiction.
According to Cantorian set theory, sets are collections built up
iteratively by constructing all possible subsets of previous sets
beginning with the empty set or a primitive set of ur-elements.

The conceptual parting of the ways between Fregean and Cantorian set
theory can be illustrated by conundrum posed to children: what happens
when an *irresistible* force meets an *immovable* object? The problem is
that an irresistible force cannot co-exist with an immovable object.
Stories with disguised self-contradictory properties have been told in
many ancient cultures and serve as cultural metaphors for logical
contradictions. [9]

What Russell’s paradox has to do with the non-existence of a universe of
a set all sets—the tension between Cantor’s powerset theorem and Frege’s
postulation of the existence of the universe of all sets—we’ll come back
to later. Our goal for the present is to formulate a first-order Fregean
foundational system and to derive the Basic Laws of Arithmetic, also
known as Peano Postulates, as theorems of that system. Only then shall
we revisit this question why paradoxes arise.

<span class="smallcaps">Exercises</span>:

1\. Much of what Frege wrote on philosophical logic remained
unpublished. Frege and his wife Margaret had several children, all of
whom died young, and so they adopted a son, Alfred, who became an
engineer. When Frege made his will in January 1925, he left his
unpublished papers to Alfred, with the following note:

Six months later, Frege died. He did not know that he would come to be
regarded as a founding father of the most influential movement in 20th
century philosophy.

Symbolize the following sentences using the dictionary provided using
modern quantifier-predicate logic, which is due to Frege.

*Dictionary*:

1.  All of Frege’s unpublished writings have some gold (*or other*).

*Paraphrase*: For all *x*, if *x* is written by Frege and *x* is
unpublished, then there is a *y*, *y* is gold and *x* has *y.*

1.  Some (particular) gold (one and the same) is contained in each of
    > Frege’s unpublished writing.

*Paraphrase*: There is a *y*, *y* is gold and for all *x*, if *x* is
written by Frege and *x* is unpublished, then *x* has *y.*

1.  It is not the case that none of Frege’s unpublished writings contain
    > gold, but it is the case that not all of Frege’s unpublished
    > writings contain gold.

*Paraphrase*: It is not the case that no F is G, but it is the case not
all F is G, where F = *x* is written by Frege and *x* is unpublished.

Symbolize all possible, if not always plausible, ambiguous readings of:

1.  There are two (elements of) gold contained in all of Frege’s
    > unpublished writings.

2.  There are two (elements of) gold in each of Frege’s unpublished
    writings.

\#2. Frege developed his own theory of definite descriptions.

The *x* such that F is symbolized by ℩*x*F*x*.

According to Frege’s theory, this term denotes the unique thing that
satisfies F*x*, if there is such an *x.* Otherwise*,* the definite
description is *improper*, and the term denotes the object chosen to be
the denotation of all improper descriptions. This chosen object is
always denoted by the logically improper definite description ℩*x x* ≠
*x*.

1.  There was one and only one author of the *Begriffsschrift* and that
    individual is identical to the one and only author of the *Die
    Grundlagen.*

2.  The author of the *Begriffsschrift* is the author of *Die
    Grundlagen*.

3.  The largest prime number is identical to the non-self-identical
    thing.

4.  Margaret was the wife of Gottlob Frege.

5.  Alfred was the adopted son of Gottlob and his wife Margaret.

Frege’s logic was a second-order logic, which is more powerful than the
first-order formulations of logic that are typically used today to
express the mathematical theories in Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. Our
reconstruction of a Fregean foundational system will be a first-order
formal system. However, we will examine Frege’s second-order laws
temporarily to derive two first-order principles concerning sets and
their extensions, which are consequences of his Basic Law V.

*Frege’s Basic Law V*: For any concepts F and G,

{*x*|F*x*} = {*x*|G*x*} ↔ ∀*x*(F*x* ↔ G*x*)

There is an important principle that can be derived from Basic Law V—a
second order versio of the Axioms of Comprehension:

> *Axiom of Abstraction*: given any concept or property F, there is a
> set consisting of all and only those things that “fall under” the
> concept or have the property F, i.e.,

∀*F*∀*x*(*x* ∈ {*y*|F*y*} ↔ F*x*} .

In other words, any concept determines an object, namely, the
*extension* of the concept or the set of all objects falling under the
concept. It will turn out that seemingly innocuous principle is the
faulty pillar of Frege’s foundational system. One way to see that it
will violate a fundamental principle of “Cantorian Set Theory” is that
this principle implies that there exists an object that corresponds to
every concept, namely the set that is the extension of the concept.

<span class="smallcaps">Propositional Logic</span>: Here we use the

in ϕ(*x*).

## Theorems of the Fregean Foundational System

We begin by establishing the existence of the universal set. The first
step is to show that every set is equal to itself. According to
propositional logic, we have the theorem T91 P ↔ P, which has as an
instance,

*y* ∈ *x* ↔ *y* ∈ *x ,*

which implies by UD and extensionality that every set is equal to
itself.

***Theorem*** 1. ∀*x* *x* = *x* (Every set is equal to itself.)

1\. *<s>Show</s>* ∀*x* *x* = *x* 5, UD

2\. *<s>Show</s>* ∀*y*(*y* ∈ *x* ↔ *y* ∈ *x*) 3, UD

3\. *y* ∈ *x* ↔ *y* ∈ *x* **T**91

4\. *x* = *x* ↔ ∀*y*(*y* ∈ *x* ↔ *y* ∈ *x*) *Extensionality*

5\. *x* = *x* 4, BC, 2, MP

Having established that every set is self-identical, we can define the
universal set.

***Definition* 1**. V := {*x*|*x* = *x*} (V is the *universal set*)

Everything is a member of the universal set V, including V itself.

***Theorem*** 2. ∀*x* *x* ∈ V

1\. *<s>Show</s>* ∀*x* *x* ∈ V 4, UD

2\. *<s>Show</s>* ∀*x* *x* ∈ {*x*|*x* = *x*} 5, UD

3\. ∀*x*\[*x* ∈ {*x*|*x* = *x*} ↔ *x* = *x*\] *Abstraction*

4\. *x* ∈ {*x*|*x* = *x*} ↔ *x* = *x* 3, UI

5\. *x* = *x* Theorem 1, UI

6\. *x* ∈ {*x*|*x* = *x*} 4, BC, 5, MP

7\. ∀*x* *x* ∈ V 2, Def. V

***Corolla***ry 2.1. **V** ∈ **V** (The universal set V contains
itself.)

Next we construct the empty set ∅ using the universal negative property
of being non-self-identical.

***Definition*** 2. ∅ = {*x*|*x* ≠ *x*}

Since nothing has the property of being non-self-identical, the empty
set has no members.

***Theorem*** 3. ∀*x* *x* ∉ ∅

Does the empty set really exist? Bas van Fraassen offered the following
“ontological proof” for the existence of the empty set for skeptics:
“The fool hath said in his heart “there is no empty set.” But then
consider the set of all empty sets. This set would be empty.
Contradiction. Hence, the empty set exists.”

By extensionality, the empty set is unique.

***Theorem*** 4. ∀*y* (∀*x* *x* ∉ *y* ↔ *y* = ∅)

Next we define some set-theoretic relations—subsets, power sets,
complements, intersections, unions—that enable us to derive the
principles of *Boolean algebra* as theorems.

***Definition*** 3. A ⊆ B := ∀*z*(*z* ∈ A → *z* ∈ B), where the variable
*z* does not occur in A or B.

***Theorem* 5**. A = B ↔ A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A

The *complement* of a set A is defined as the set of all things *not* in
A.

***Definition*** 4. A<sup>c</sup> := {*x* | *x* ∉ A}, where A is any
set.

The *intersection* of sets A and B is defined as the set of elements in
both A and B.

***Definition*** 5. (A ∩ B) := {*x* | *x* ∈ A ∧ *x* ∈ B}, where A and B
are sets.

The *union* of sets A and B is defined as the set of all things that are
elements of A or B.

***Definition*** 6. (A ∪ B) := {*x* | *x* ∈ A ∨ *x* ∈ B}, where A and B
are sets.

The *difference* of sets A and B is defined as the set of all things
that are elements of A but not of B.

***Definition*** 7. (A ─ B) := {*x* |*x* ∈ A ∧ *x* ∉ B}, where A and B
are sets.

\#1. Construct proofs for Theorems 3, 4, and 5.

\#2. Prove each of the following conditions are equivalent. You may use
the corresponding biconditional propositional theorems and the rule of

2.  A ⊆ B Assume (BD)

5.  ∀*x*(*x* ∈ A ∩ B ↔ *x* ∈ A) 4, Def. ∩

6.  A ∩ B = A 5, <span class="smallcaps">Ext</span>.

In a *biconditional derivation* you may assume one constituent of the

Interchange of Equivalents (IE), i.e., by a previously proven

constituent is obtained. Then the subsequent lines can be boxed and
cancelled by biconditional derivation \[BD\].

## A Digression: Boole’s Life and Logic.

> “The design of the following treatise is to investigate the
> fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is
> performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a
> Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of Logic
> and construct its method; to make that method itself the basis of a
> general method for the application of the mathematical doctrine of
> Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of
> truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable
> intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind.”

— <span class="smallcaps">George Boole</span>, *An Investigation of the
Laws of Thought* (1854)

Logic, according to Boole, deals with the “laws of thought”—those
“fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is
performed.” These laws can be expressed mathematically as a calculus or
algebra. Boole regarded his discovery of the laws of thought as

Contemporary philosophers would be careful to distinguish between the
*descriptive* or *empirical* laws of thought and the *prescriptive* or
*normative* laws of the science of correct reasoning. Nevertheless,
Boole’s conception of his project was an inspiring one.

In the digital world today, one often hears about “Boolean variables”—0
and 1, true or false. One might think, what a simple idea! Why did
someone have to invent it? What sense can be made of such peculiar
equations as 1 + 1 = 0? In this chapter, we shall look at the backstory
of Boole’s work in logic in which Boolean variables are simply a
beginning.[10]

Boole (1815-1864) was the son of a poor English shoemaker who had a
strong interest in science and mathematics, in Lincoln, England. George
was a self-taught prodigy. At the age of 14, young George translated a
Greek poem that was published in the local paper. At the age of 16, he
was hired as a teacher and learned calculus on his own. Supporting
himself by starting his own elementary school at the age of 19, Boole
developed educational theories about the importance of discovery,
emphasizing the importance of deep understanding as opposed to rote
memorization. By the age of 23, he began publishing papers on the
mathematics of his time, but his interests soon turned towards
expressing the laws of logic in a mathematical form, which would become
to be known as the Boolean algebra of logic. A talented lecturer Boole
explored way of bending algebra so it could be used to express laws of
logic so that algebraic operations would corresponding to valid logical
inferences.

The result was a concise monograph, 86 pages in length, entitled *The
Mathematical Analysis of Logic* \[1847\]. As a result of this book,
Boole began corresponding with leading British mathematicians of his
day. Boole considered going to Cambridge to become a “university person”
but was put off then told he would have to start with a standard
undergraduate course and stop doing his own research. Boole’s friend,
the logician Augustus De Morgan had become involved in controversies,
and this caused Boole to shy away from controversy and to continue
developing his own thoughts on the matter.

Approaching logic in terms of mathematics was significant because it
brought together two streams of thought. Since ancient times, logic and
mathematics has developed on different trajectories. Although Aristotle
regarded logic as propaedeutic to science and mathematics, Aristotle’s
syllogistic logic was inadequate for explaining the mathematical
reasoning involved in Euclid’s *Elements*. The philosopher Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 – 1716) had dreamed of a universal alphabet of
thought (*characteristic universalis)* in which ideas could be
represented to that disputes among philosophers could be resolved by a
symbolic logic (*calculus ratiocinator*) in the same way as disputes
among mathematicians:

> The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as
> those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a
> glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say:
> Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right.

Boole’s work was revolutionary because it brought these two streams of
thought that has been developing independently—logic and
mathematics—together. In 1849 Boole was hired by Queen’s College, Cork
(now University College Cork) as its first professor of mathematics
(which was considered a less prestigious than classical subjects like
Latin or Greek).[11]

As a university professor, Boole began writing his famous book *An
Investigation of the Laws of Thought: the Mathematical Theories of Logic
and Probabilities* \[1854\]*.* The first part of the book expresses the
laws of thought as algebraic laws in which the variables take on the
Boolean values of 0 or 1. In the second part of the book, the algebraic
variables are interpreted as probabilities also taking on values between
0 and 1. In the final chapter of his book, Boole discusses such
philosophical questions as whether free will is compatible with definite
laws of thought and whether there are truths that go beyond what
mathematical laws can explain.

Eager to apply his methods to philosophical arguments such as proofs for
the existence of God’s existence, Boole illustrated his logic by
applying it to the proofs given by Samuel Clarke. (Clark was a follower
of Newton, who was embroiled in a bitter dispute with Leibniz about
priority in the discovery the calculus.) Here Boole was careful to
distinguish between proving the truth of the conclusion and proving that
the conclusion of an argument followed logically from its premises:

> Herein too may be felt the powerlessness of mere Logic, the
> insufficiently of the profoundest knowledge of the laws of the
> understanding, to resolve those problems which lie nearer to our
> hearts, as progressive years strip away from our life the illusions of
> its golden dawn.

Logic can determined whether a conclusion such as “God exists” follows
from a set of premises, but it cannot determined exactly what the
premises state or, given they have some definite meaning, whether they
are true. “The chief practical difficulty of this inquiry,” Boole noted,
“will consist, not in the application of the method to the premises once
determined, but in ascertaining what the premises are.”

While at Queen’s College George Boole met in 1850 his future Mary
Everest, the niece of a John Ryall, a professor of Greek, and they were
married give year later. Although single for most of his life, Boole
married at the age of in 1855. Although single for most of his life
Boole at the age of 40 married Mary Everest Boole, who was 17 years
younger. Boole died seven years later after walking in the rain to give
his lecture while soaking wet. His wife, following the medical advice of
the day, doused him with cold water when he got home. Boole caught
pneumonia and died. His wife outlived him by 56 years and published
books herself with such intriguing titles as *Philosophy and the Fun of
Algebra*, *Logic Taught by Love*, and *The Message of Psychic Science to
the World*.

Boole’s work is based upon observing an intriguing symmetry between the
laws of logic and algebra. Imagine Boole’s excitement at discovering
that Aristotle’s Laws of Thought could be formulated in a Boolean
algebra in which the values of the variables are either 1 or 0,
corresponding to true and false! Propositions in logic have one of the
two truth-values, true or false. This is analogous to an algebra in
which the values of the variables are one of two distinct values 1 or 0.
If a variable *x* has one of those two values, then its *complement* (1
− *x*) has the opposite value, thus corresponding to *negation* in
logic. The *product* of *x* and *y*, *x* ⊗ *y*, has the value 1 if and
only if both *x* and *y* have the value 1, which corresponds to the
truth rule for “*and*”: a *conjunction* (P ∧ Q) is true if and only if
both P and Q are true.

In defining the operation of addition ⊕, the above correspondences still
leave open two choices. These choices correspondence to two
interpretations for the disjunction—the *inclusive* “*or*” (symbolized
by ‘∨’ for the Latin *vel*) or the *exclusive* ‘*or’* (in Latin *aut* or
in computer science *xor* and symbolized by ⊽ or the negation of a
biconditional ↮):

The latter interpretation leads to the equation 1 + 1 = 0, which looks
suspicious. At least it did to the English logician William Stanley
Jevons (1835 -1882), who, in an 1863 letter, criticized Boole harshly:

> It is surely obvious, however, that X + X is equivalent only to X, …
> Professor Boole’s notation … is inconsistent with a self-evident law.
> If my view be right, his system will come to be regarded as a most
> remarkable combination of truth and error.

Evidently Jevons was thinking of + in terms of an operation like the
*union* of set in which we have the law *x* ∪ *x* = *x*. However,
Boole’s conception of + was in terms of the *disjoint* union of X and Y,
so that

X + Y = (X – Y) ∪ (Y – X) , whereupon substituting X for Y yields *x* +
*x* = 0. When Jevons continued to press his criticism, Boole in
exasperation replied:

> To be explicit, I now, however, reply that it is not true that in
> Logic *x* + *x* = *x*, though it is true that *x* + *x* = 0 is
> equivalent to *x* = 0. If I do not write more it is not from any
> unwillingness to discuss the subject with you, but simply because if
> we differ on this fundamental point it is impossible that we should
> agree in others.

Obviously how will formulate the laws of logic will depend on how + is
to be interpreted. For example, here are two forms of disjunction
syllogism—one is formulated using the exclusive ‘*or’* and the other
using with the *inclusive* ‘*or’*. The Boolean equations on the right
correspond to the law of disjunctive syllogism (*inclusive* or
*exclusive* ‘*or’*) on the left:

Rather than challenging individual laws in isolation, it is more help to
examine how the proposed laws functioned within Boole’s *system* of
algebraic logic.

Why was Frege’s conception of logic an advance over Boole’s? Out the
outset it is important to distinguish, as Boole did not, between the
*descriptive* *empirical* laws “concerning the nature and constitution
of the human mind” and the *prescriptive* *normative* laws of the
science of logic. Boole’s conception of logic as the laws of thought
confused descriptive and prescriptive questions: do the laws of logic
describe the physics of thought or do they prescribe what is required of
correct thinking?

Secondly, Boole failed to give a formal account of when a sequence of
equations constituted a proof. Our Fregean Foundational system has been
build on the foundation of a system of logic in which the rules of proof
are formally characterized.

Thirdly, Boole’s logic exploited isomorphisms between Aristotle’s
Syllogistic Logic, Boolean Set Theory, and Propositional Logic; however,
Boole’s logic was still inadequate for the formalizing of richness of
mathematical thinking.

Boolean algebras are useful because many different applications within
logic, mathematics and linguistics share this kind of structure—the
structure of partially order sets or *Posets*—with the operations of
*join* and *meet*.

-   Consider all the subsets of {*a*, *b*, *c*} ordered by the subset
    relation with the operations of intersection ‘∩’ (*meet* or ↓ in the
    lattice), union ‘∪’ (*joint* or ↑ in the lattice), and
    complementation ‘A<sup>c</sup>’.

-   Consider the set of numbers that are the set of factors of 30: {1,
    2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}. Interpret *meet* (or *infimum*) as the
    greatest common divisor (↓ in the lattice), *join* (or *supremum*)
    as the least common multiple (↑ in the lattice), and *inverse* of a
    number *x* as the number 30/*x*.

These two Boolean algebras have exactly the same structure. Indeed, the
isomorphic mapping between the two lattices is easy to see when we
replace each of the composite numbers on the right-hand lattice with set
of their prime factors. (By convention 1 is not prime in order to ensure
that every number as a unique prime factorization. Since 1 has no prime
factors, it corresponds to the empty set.)

The rules and the law for manipulating algebraic expressions that Boole
formulated were sufficiently mechanical that the English logician W. S.
Jevons was able to use them to build a mechanical reasoning machine,
which he demonstrated, to the Royal Society in 1870.

The relationships between Boolean Algebra and propositional logic can be
seen in the following lattice, which happens to be equivalent to a
tesseract or hyper-cube:

style="width:6.5in;height:4.875in" />

What can be said in assessment of Boole’s logic? Boole developed a rich
and suggested algebra of logic. Boole’s algebra has certain similarities
with ordinary arithmetic, but also some striking differences. For
example, the distributive laws of × over + holds:

*x* × (*y* + *z*) = (*x* × *y*) + (*x* × *z*);

However, the law of the distribution of + over × does not have a
counterpart in ordinary arithmetic:

*x* + (*y* × *z*) = (*x* + *y*) × (*x* + *z*) .

Working with algebraic analogies, Boole did not provide a precise formal
language, which leads to our first criticism: Boole failed to give a
formal account of when a sequence of equations constituted a proof. Our
second criticism is the Boole’s logic is *expressively inadequate*:
Boole’s logic is still inadequate for the formalizing of richness of
mathematical thinking. In particular, Boole’s logic is missing a
calculus of relations. Thirdly, Boole failed to distinguish the
descriptive from a prescriptive account of reasoning: does his laws of
thought describe the physics of thought or do they prescribe the laws
required for correct logical reasoning?

## Peano’s Postulates as Theorems

Next we commence a Fregean logical construction of the natural numbers.

In order to answer the question “What is number?” correctly, one must be
clear on, what Russell, influenced by Wittgenstein, called, the
*grammar* of our inquiry. What we are seeking is not an understanding of
particular numbers, like 0 and 1, but the concept of number itself. No
particular collection having a certain number of objects, for example,
will be identical with that number. Moreover, we must distinguish the
concept of two collections *having the same number of elements*, which
is logically prior to, but an essential step towards, logically
constructing *the concept of number* in general.

There is no better way to introduce puzzles about the concept number and
the important of securing the foundations of arithmetic, than to quote
the opening of Frege’s *Grundlagen*:

> “When we ask someone what the number one is, or what the symbol 1
> means, we get as a rule the answer “Why, a thing”. And if we go on to
> point out that the proposition
>
> “the number one is a thing”
>
> is not a definition, because it has the definite article on one side
> and the indefinite on the other, or that is only assigns the number
> one to the class of things, without stating which thing it is, then we
> shall very likely be invited to select something for
> ourselves—anything we please—to call one. Yet, if everyone had the
> right to understand by this name whatever he pleased, then the same
> proposition about one would mean different things for different
> people, —such propositions would have no common content.
>
> Some, perhaps, will decline to answer the question, pointing out that
> it is impossible to state, either, what is meant by the letter *a*, as
> it is used in arithmetic; and if we were to say ‘*a* means a number,”
> this would be open to the same objection as the definition “one is a
> thing.” Now I the case of *a* it is quite right to decline to answer:
> *a* does not mean some one definite number which can be specified, but
> serves to express the generality of general propositions. If, in *a* +
> *a* – *a* = *a*, we put for *a* some number, any we please but the
> same throughout, we get always a true identity. This is the sense in
> which the letter *a* is used.
>
> With one, however, the position is essentially different. Can we, in
> the identity 1 + 1 = 2 put for 1 in both places some one and the same
> object, say the Moon? On the contrary, it looks as though, whatever we
> put for the first 1, we must put something different for the second.
> Why it is that we have to do here precisely what would have been wrong
> in the other case?...”
>
> “Questions like these catch even mathematicians for that matter, or
> most of them, unprepared with any satisfactory answer. Yet is it not a
> scandal that our science should be so unclear about the first and
> foremost among its objects, and one which is apparently so simple?
> Small hope, then, that we shall be able to say what number is. If a
> concept fundamental to a mighty science gives rise to difficulties,
> then it is surely an imperative task to investigate it more closely
> until those difficulties are overcome; especially as we shall hardly
> succeed in finally clearing up negative numbers, or fractional or
> complex numbers, so long as our insight into the foundation of the
> whole of arithmetic is still defective.”

According to Bertrand Russell, the reason why it took so long to
discover a definition of natural numbers was that the natural numbers
was thought of as the result of counting:

> The philosophy of arithmetic was wrongly conceived by every writer
> before Frege. The mistake that all of them made was a very natural
> one. They thought of numbers as resulting from counting, and got into
> hopeless puzzles because things that are counted as one can equally
> well be counted as many. p. 53

Consider Frege’s *relativity argument* from his *Grundlagen* \[1884\]:

> “What number is represented by a standard deck of cards?” Excluding
> jokers, there are 52 playing cards in a complete deck. However, aren’t
> there other numbers that the deck can represent? There are 13 ordinal
> card rankings—Aces, deuces, threes, fours, …., tens, Jacks, Queens,
> Kings. There are 4 suits of cards—hearts, spades, diamonds, and clubs.
> There are 2 decks one consisting of all the black cards and the other
> consisting of all the red cards. Or why can’t I simply say there is
> just 1 complete deck?

So what’s the point? Bertrand Russell explains:

> It is obvious, therefore, that what makes anything one from a point of
> view of counting is not its physical constitution, but the question,
> ‘Of what is this an instance?’ The number that you arrive at by
> counting is the number of some collection, and that collection has
> whatever number it does have before you count it. It is only *qua*
> many instances of something that a collection is many. The collection
> itself will be an instance of something else, and *qua* instance
> counts as one in enumeration. We are thus forced to face the question,
> ‘What is a collection?’ and ‘What is an instance?’….

Let’s consider more carefully how children learn to count. One way to
begin is by teaching the child begins to count the fingers on one hand
with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At first the child may practice
enumerating the fingers in exactly the same way, perhaps beginning with
the pointer finger as 1, the middle finger as 2, and ending with the
thumb as 5. (There are some interesting cultural differences in the way
children are taught to count. For example, American children are taught
to point their fingers while counting, whereas Chinese children are
typically taught to close their fingers while counting.)

Now ask the child if you’ll get the same result if you count the fingers
in a *different order*. Does it make a difference whether you count the
fingers from left to right or right to left? Will you get to the same
number if you *count* your fingers in any *order* so long as you don’t
count the same finger twice?

Next the child is taught how to count a set of objects such as the
following set of symbols:

One way to do this is to pair them one-to-one with the fingers on one
hand. Here we have the beginnings of the distinction between *order* and
*size*, between what mathematicians call the *ordinal* numbers (*first,
second, third*, ….) and what they call the *cardinal* numbers (one, two,
three, … ). The child discovers that if you can pair the symbols in a
one-to-one fashion with the fingers on one hand, then there are the
*same number* of fingers and as are symbols. And as we have already
discovered there are five fingers on one hand. Hence, there are five
symbols.

The child may then begin to recognize geometric properties of the
symbols. The circle can be drawn with s single line. The cross is made
using two line segments. The triangle has three sides. The square has
four sides, and the pentagon has five sides. There is a natural way to
pair the numbers with the shapes, but it turns out that no matter what
order you count the shapes, so long as each shapes is counted once and
only once, you will end up counting that there are five shapes.

From this simple example, we can see that numbers are used in two
different ways—to list the symbols in some *order* and to describe the
*size* of the set. This is the intuitive difference between *ordinals*
(numbers used to *order* the collection) and *cardinals* (numbers used
to assign a *size* to the collection). An *ordinal* number relates to a
thing’s *position* in a series or sequence—whether it occurs first,
second, or third in our counting sequence. A *cardinal* number, on the
other hand, describes the *size* of a set. When we’re done counting or
enumerating the members of the above set, the last *ordinal* number
gives us the *cardinal* number of that set of objects.

According to Russell, when you say that a set has three elements, you
are using “3” as an *adjective* to describe the set as having a certain
property. In contrast, when you assert that 3 + 5 = 8, you are using “3”
as a *noun* to refer to a mathematical object, “5” as a noun to refer to
another mathematical object, and asserting that combining these two
objects with the operation of addition results in another mathematical
object, the number 8.

Must the arithmetic for ordinals obey that same laws as those for
cardinals? Consider, for example, Henry VIII (1491 – 1547), who ruled
England from 1509 until his death. Did we arrive at Henry VII by taking
three Henrys and then adding five more:

3 + 5 = 8 .

No, Henry VIII is just one man (although he had six marriages)[12]. What
we can say using this equation is that Henry VIII was the fifth king
called Henry after Henry III. You can list your Henrys in the row: if
you advance three steps along your list and then advance five more that
the say at going from the first to the eighth position. When you think
about it this way, it is not immediately evident that addition must be
commutative. In fact, the arithmetic for infinite ordinals fails to
follow the rules for finite ordinals.

Addition for ordinals α + β is the result of α followed by β then
recounting. For example:

2 1 0 4 3 2 1 0

3 + 5 | | | | | | | | = 8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

For finite numbers this operation is commutative:

4 3 2 1 0 2 1 0

5 + 3 | | | | | | | | = 8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

However, this law does not hold for infinite ordinal numbers.

*<u>Digression</u>*: Can infinity be a number? According to David
Hilbert’s formalist conception of mathematics, a mathematical object
exists if we can construct a consistent formal system in which infinity
is treated as a number. Hence, mathematical existence depends, in this
sense, on logic.

Here’s how to construct an ordinal arithmetic. The first infinite
ordinal is ω. It is the next ordinal after all of {0, 1, 2, 3, ….}. How
can we represent this ordinal? One way is to picture them as an infinite
array of telephone poles that appear shorter and shorter as they
approach the horizon:

<img src="./attachments/$myfilename/media/image4.jpeg"
style="width:1.25764in;height:1.08194in"
alt="Mac HD:Users:gary:Desktop:Unknown.jpeg" />

Let’s see what we get when we compare 1 + ω with ω + 1:

1 + ω = ω ≠ ω + 1

When we renumber the telephone poles on the left, we simply get ω again,
but we get something structurally different on the right. As we shall
see, Cantor’s arithmetic of ordinals and cardinals leads to some quite
beautiful arithmetic truths:

ω + 1 ≠ 1 + ω, 2 × ω = 2ω &lt; ω × 2 = ω + ω, *ω*<sup>*ω*</sup> = 1 +
*ω*<sup>1</sup>+ *ω*<sup>2</sup>+ *ω*<sup>3</sup> + …,

*ϵ*<sub>0</sub>= 1 +
*ω*+ *ω*<sup>*ω*</sup>+ *ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>*ω*</sup></sup> + *ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>*ω*</sup></sup></sup> +
…
= *ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>*ω*<sup>.<sup>.<sup>.</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>

End of disgression.

Kronecker famously said that God created the natural numbers, and
mankind created the rest. If Kronecker was willing to leave the creation
of the natural numbers to God, Frege was not. Frege was intent on taking
the foundation project even further back. Frege’s idea is to construct a
set-theoretical object that provably satisfies the Peano A*x*ioms. If
this construction can be accomplished and the Peano Axioms derived as
theorems, then all the arithmetical consequences of the Peano Axioms
will have been deduced from, and reduced to, logic together with set
theory.

The Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858 – 1932) advanced the
algebraic period of mathematical logic through his axiomatization of the
natural numbers including the method of mathematical induction (which
are known, in his honor, as Peano’s postulates) through his *Formulario*
Project (1891) and his in *Notations de Logique* (1894). Boole’s and
Peano’s work, along with that of the American pragmatist C. S. Pierce
(1839 – 1914) and the German mathematician and logician Ernst Schröder
(1841 – 1902), advanced logic from is adolescent algebraic period to the
more mature period of modern symbolic logic at the dawn of
20<sup>th</sup> century.

At the dawn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in 1900, Bertrand Russell
(1872 - 1970) attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in
Paris where he became acquainted with the notation of Peano. In *My
Philosophical Development* \[1959\] Russell writes about the revelation
inspired Peano’s notation:

> It was at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in the
> year 1900 that I became aware of the importance of logical reform for

The enlightenment that I derived from Peano came mainly from two purely
technical advances of which it is very difficult to appreciate the
importance unless one had (as I had) spent years in trying to understand
arithmetic. Both these advances had been made at an earlier date by
Frege, but I doubt whether Peano knew this.… \[pp. 51-2\]

*Peano’s Planets.* Once upon a time, there was a universe of planets
called *Omega* ω. Each of the planets in *Omega* gives birth to another
planet called the child of that planet. Symbolize the following
planetary postulates using the dictionary provided:

> P<sub>1</sub>. The *null planet* is in ω.
>
> P<sub>2</sub>. Every planet in ω has a (unique) *child*.
>
> P<sub>3</sub>. The null planet is not the *child* of any planet.
>
> P<sub>4</sub>. No two planets have the same child.
>
> P<sub>5</sub>. For every set of planets Σ, if

1.  the null planet is in Σ and

2.  for every planet in Σ its child is in Σ,

> then every planet is in Σ (i.e., ω ⊆ Σ).

Dictionary:

0 : the null planet

> ω : the universe of planets
>
> *x* ∈ ω : *x* is a planet in Omega

S(*x*) : the child of *x*

> *x* = *y*: *x* is identical as *y, i.e., x* and *y* are the same
> planet
>
> *x* ≠ *y*: *x* is not identical to *y, i.e., x* and *y* are different
> planets

A ⊆ B: A is a subset of B

As you have probably guessed, these planetary postulates are Peano’s
postulate for the natural numbers:

P<sub>1</sub>: 0 is a natural number

P<sub>2</sub>: If *x* is a natural number, so is the successor of *x*.

P<sub>3</sub>. For any natural number *x*, 0 is not the successor of
*x*.

P4. No two distinct natural numbers have the same successor.

P<sub>5</sub>. *Principle of Mathematical Induction*: For any set Σ, if

1.  0 is a member of Σ,

2.  for every natural number *x*, *x* is a member of Σ then the
    successor of *x* is a member of Σ,

> then all natural numbers are in Σ.

Our next task is to derive the Peano’s Postulates as *theorems* of our
Fregean foundational system. Here is a list of the Peano’s Postulates
(we use “numbers” to mean “natural numbers”).

Peano’s postulates were first published in 1889, but an instructive
discussion of the postulates was discovered in an 1890 letter by
Dedekind. This letter was first translated and published in 1957[13] by
Hao Wang. Dedekind calls such anomalies as the Quixotic planets “alien
intruders”:

> The postulates “are still far from being adequate for completely
> characterizing the nature of the number sequence *N*… What, then, must
> we add to the facts above in order to cleanse our system … again of
> such alien intruders … as disturb every vestige of order and to
> restrict it to *N*?”

We can ask some questions about the kind of structure Peano’s postulates
impose upon our universe.

1.  Must Omega ω have an infinite number of planets?

2.  According to ancient Omegan mythology, there is an alien planet Q
    (known as a *Quixotic* planet) that was *created after* (in symbols,
    &gt;) the null planet or any of its *descendants* (we may define
    inductively the notion of a *descendant* of a planet to be either
    the child of that planet or any child of a descendant):

{Q &gt; \[0\], Q &gt; \[1\], Q &gt; \[2\], Q &gt; \[3\], …}

Is such a mythological *Quixotic* universe *consistent* with the Peano
planetary postulates?

1.  (Larson’s Question) Planets are *created before* (in symbols, α &lt;
    β) and *created after* (in symbols, α &gt; β) each other. Suppose we
    add a new postulate that says that any two planets in Omega are
    *comparable* with respect to creation: for any two planets α and β
    (in symbols, α ≠ β) either α was *created before* β or β was
    *created after* α. We can express comparability as follows:

α ≠ β → (α &lt; β) ∨ (β &gt; α) .

Does adding this postulate of *comparability* rule out the existence of
*alien intruders*? (These alien intruders have the form of Z-chains or
*n*-cycles).

Frege’s goal is to logically construct the natural numbers in set theory
so that the Peano postulates are derivable as theorems. Kronecker
famously said that God created the natural numbers, and man created the
rest. If Kronecker was willing to leave the creation of the natural
numbers to God, Frege was not. Frege was intent on taking the foundation
projects even further back. Frege’s idea is to construct a
set-theoretical object that provably satisfies the Peano A*x*ioms. If
this construction can be accomplished and the Peano Axioms derived as
theorems, then all the arithmetical consequences of the Peano Axioms
will have been deduced from, and reduced to, logic together with set
theory.

***Definition***: {ξ} := {*x* | *x* = ξ}, where ξ is any term and *x* is
a variable not occurring in ξ.

(The *singleton* set {ξ} is defined as a set consisting of ξ alone.)

Next we define *zero* to be the empty set. Here rather than follow
Frege’s and Russell’s logical construction, which defines the number 3
to be the *class* of all sets which have three elements, we shall follow
von Neumann’s idea of defined the number 3 to be a particular three
element *set*. It is more elegant to have numbers as sets within our
Fregean foundational system.

***Definition***. 0 := ∅

Next we define the *successor* of a set α (in symbols, α<sup>+</sup>) to
be the set consisting of α ∪ {α}.

***Definition***. For any set α, S(α) = α ∪ {α}.

Alonzo Church was one of the great logicians of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. When Church used to count the number of handouts to pass down a
row with seven students, he could say, “zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six and that makes seven” and then put down seven pieces of paper.
When you count Church’s way, then the *number* of objects you’ve counted
is the earliest number that you *didn’t* use. In Church’s system when
you count an empty set of things you arrive at the number zero since it
is the first number you didn’t use (since you didn’t use any). Although
this procedure might seem odd, it is really very natural for some
purposes. If you order 1000 lottery tickets, there usually numbered from
000 to 999.

Many logicians prefer to count objects starting with zero rather than
one since that is the natural way to logically construct the ordinal
numbers. Von Neumann’s elegant idea was that each ordinal can be defined
as the well-ordered set of all previous ordinals.

Unlike Zermelo’s construction in which 3 = {{{0}}}, von Neumann’s idea
generalized to infinite ordinals.

We define an *inductive set* to be a set that contains 0 and the
successors of all its members.

***Definition***. I*y* ↔ \[0 ∈ *y* ∧ ∀*z*(*z* ∈ *y* → S(*z*) ∈ *y*)\],
where *y* and *z* are distinct variables.

Next we defined the “natural numbers” to be in the intersection of every
inductive set.

***Definition***. **N** := {*x*| ∀*y*(I*y* → *x* ∈ *y*)}.

V is an inductive set. To prove that zero is a natural number, we show
that zero is a member of every inductive set, which is obvious by
construction.

Our next theorem is the Peano Postulate stating the schema for
mathematical deduction: if zero has the property F and whenever a
natural number has the property F its successor has the property F, then
all natural numbers have the property F. This property of the natural
numbers is also obvious given that the natural numbers are a member of
every inductive set. The von Neumann construction makes it easy to
define &lt; as set membership ∈, which allow us to state a strong form
of induction. Strong induction is equivalent to the Least Number
Principle and Fermat’s Method of Proof by Infinite Descent:

1.  ∪α ⊆ α

2.  α ⊆ P(α)

3.  α is transitive

## Numerals, Finite and Infinite Sets

The standard *numerals* can be introduced as successive applications the
successor operation to zero. Here \[*n*\] is the numeral corresponding
to the number *n*, and S*<sup>n</sup>* is an abbreviation for applying
the successor operation *n* times.

***Definition***. \[1\] := S(0); \[2\] := S(1), \[3\] := S(2); \[4\] :=
S(3); \[5\] := S(4), …, \[*n*\] := S*<sup>n</sup>*(0)

We can now define finite and infinite sets. A set is finite if and only
if it is an element of a natural number, and the set is infinite if and
only if it is not finite.

***Definition***. <span class="smallcaps">Fin</span>(α) := ∃*x*(*x* ∈
**N** ∧ α ∈ *x*), where α is any term in which the variable *x* does not
occur.

***Definition***. <span class="smallcaps">Inf</span>(α) :=
~<span class="smallcaps">Fin</span>(α), where α is any term.

What can be said for our Fregean foundational system that we have
developed thus far? First, our foundational system has been expressed as
a formal system and it has been adequate to prove a reasonably large
portion of mathematics. We can subsume both Aristotle’s syllogistic
logic and Boolean algebra. Secondly, the foundation has been derives
from some intuitively natural principles. It seems intuitively true that
a property can be used to define the set of all things having the given
property, so long as that property is restricted to those that can be
expressed in our formal language. Thirdly, our basic principles have
been economical. We have only two basic postulates for set theory and
our underlying system of natural deduction has allowed us to derive
relatively complex theorems in a systematic and orderly manner.

There is however a fundamental problem: our Fregean foundational system
is quite inconsistent.

## Russell’s Paradox

Russell's paradox, perhaps the most famous of all the set-theoretical
paradoxes, destroyed Frege’s dream of completing his logicist project.
And it couldn’t have come as a more disappointing time. Just as the
second volume of Frege’s *Gründgesetze* was in the press, Frege received
a devastating letter from Bertrand Russell in which he derived a
contradiction from his Basic Law V, a principle from which our Fregean
abstraction principle can be derived.

> Basic Law V: {*x*|*f*(*x*)} = {*x*|*g*(*x*)} ↔ ∀*x*(*f*(*x*) ↔
> *g*(*x*))

Facing with the inconsistency posed by Russell’s paradox for his
foundational system, Frege reacted with unflinching scientific
integrity:

Frege’s conception of his work in logic is most grandly and eloquently
expressed in an essay written at the end of academic career, “*The
Thought: A Logical Inquiry*” (1918), in which he talks about the science
of logic, not aiming at the laws of *thought*, but at the laws of
*truth*. This vision is expressed in the quotation that introduces this
chapter.

Although expressed eloquently, Frege’s hopes for his logicist project of
reducing arithmetic to logic had foundered on Russell’s famous paradox.
On the eve of the publication of the second volume of his *Grundgesetze*
\[1903\], Frege received a fateful letter from Russell, which posed his
famous paradox. Frege immediately reproduced Russell’s paradox in his
notation and then hastily composed an appendix to his life’s work. It is
clear that Frege had the intellectual honesty to acknowledge that
Russell’s paradox threatened the consistency, and hence the validity and
value, of his entire life’s work. Here are Frege’s words:

> Hardly anything more unwelcome can befall a scientific writer than
> that one of the foundations of his edifice be shaken after the work is
> finished. I have been placed in this position by a letter of Mr.
> Bertrand Russell just as the printing of this \[second\] volume was
> nearing completion. It is a matter of my Basic Law V \[i.e., the
> abstraction principle\]. I have never concealed from myself its lack
> of the self-evidence which the others possess, and which must properly
> be demanded of a law of logic.

Frege died thinking that his life project had ended in failure. Anthony
Kenny compares Frege’s career to that of Christopher Columbus.

> Just as Columbus failed in his project of discovering a westward
> passage to India, but unknowingly make Europe acquainted with a whole
> new continent, so Frege failed in his task of deriving arithmetic from
> logic but made discoveries in logic and advances in philosophy which
> permanently changed the whole map of both subjects. Like Columbus,
> Frege failed to appreciate the full value of his own genuine
> discoveries, and he suffered discouragement and depression in
> consequence.
>
> Frege devoted the best years of his life to proving the continuity
> between arithmetic and logic. All the other innovations of his fertile
> mind were intended to serve that overarching purpose and when the
> project aborted it was natural that he should be tempted to think that
> his life’s work had been a failure.[15]

Frege’s tried, hastily, to try to repair is system, but his repairs
failed. Why was the derivation of Russell’s paradox so devastating? As
the Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy wrote in *A Mathematician’s
Apology* \[1967\], a classic defense of the mathematician’s and
logician’s life’s work, reasoning by *reductio ad absurdum* is a
dangerous game to play.

> “The proof \[of the infinity of primes\] is by *reductio ad absurdum*,
> and *reductio ad absurdum*, which Euclid loved so much, is one of the
> mathematician’s finest weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any
> chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even
> a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.”

The mathematician “offers the game” because a contradiction, in
classical logic, allows anything whatsoever to be deduced. The
derivation of Russell’s paradox, a contradiction, threatened the entire
foundation for Frege’s mathematical work.

When asked to donate his correspondence with Frege to the now classic

I should be most pleased if you would publish the correspondence between
Frege and myself, and I am grateful to you for suggesting this. As I
think about acts of integrity and grace, I realize that there is nothing
in my knowledge to compare with Frege’s dedication to the truth. His
entire life’s work was on the verge of completion, much of his work has
been ignored to the benefit of men infinitely less capable, his second
volume was about to be published, and upon finding that his fundamental
assumption was in error, he responded with intellectual pleasure clearly
submerging any feelings of personal disappointment. It was almost
superhuman and a telling indication of that of which men are capable if
their dedication is to creative work and knowledge instead of cruder
efforts to dominate and be known.

What is Russell’s paradox? It is customary to introduce the paradox with
logically similar pseudo-paradox of the barber. In the village of
Alcala, there is a barber who shave all the only those who do not shave
themselves. Who shaves the barber?

If suppose the barber shaves himself (or herself), then s/he does not
*only* those who do not shave themselves. If we suppose the barber does
not shave him or herself, then s/he does not shave *all* those who do
not shave themselves. We can conclude there can be no such barber.

Russell’s paradox, unlike the pseudo-paradox of the barber, is
considered to be an *antinomy* (from *anti* (against) + *nomos* (law))
because the existence of the Russell set seems to be guaranteed by
intuitive laws for the existence of sets. As Gödel wrote in his essay on
“Russell’s Mathematical Logic” \[1944\], the significance of Russell’s
paradox is this:

> “By analyzing the paradoxes to which Cantor’s set theory had led, he
> freed them from all mathematical technicalities, thus bringing to
> light the amazing fact that our logical intuitions (i.e., intuitions
> concerning such notions as: truth, concept, being, class, etc. are
> self-contradictory.” (p. 452, Benacerraf & Putnam)

Russell’s paradox can be intuitively sketched as follows. As we have
seen, some set contain themselves as elements, such as the universal set
V. However, most sets do not contain themselves as elements, e.g., such
as the set of natural numbers is not a natural number and so is not a
member of itself. Color all the sets that do contain themselves as
members green and all the sets that do not contain themselves as members
red. Now consider the collection R of all and only red sets. If R
colored red or green? If it is colored red, then since R contains all
the red sets, R is a member of R and so must be colored green. However,
if R is colored green, then it must be a member of itself, but then it
must be red because R contains only red sets.

Here are the formal derivations in our Fregean foundational system.

***Theorem*** 11. {*x*| *x* ∉ *x*} ∉ {*x* | *x* ∉ *x*} (i.e., R = {*x*|
*x* ∉ *x*} is not a member of itself).

1\. *<s>Show</s>* {*x*| *x* ∉ *x*} ∉ {*x* | *x* ∉ *x*} 2, 4 ID

2\. {*x*| *x* ∉ *x*} ∈ {*x*| *x*∉*x*} Assume (ID)

3\. {*x*| *x* ∉ *x* }∈ {*x*|*x*∉*x*} ↔ {*x*|*x* ∉ *x*} ∉ {*x*|*x*∉*x*}
Abstraction

4\. {*x*| *x* ∉ *x*} ∉ {*x*| *x*∉*x*} 3, BC, 2, MP

***Theorem*** 12. {*x*|*x* ∉ *x*} ∈ {*x*| *x*∉*x*} (i.e., R = {*x*| *x*
∉ *x*} is a member of itself). We leave as an exercise.

Frege’s foundation for arithmetic was based on the faulty intuition was
that for any property, there is the corresponding set of all and only
those things that have the property. This is called the *naïve
comprehension axiom* (naïve because we now know it to be too simple to
be true).

We can express the logic that generates Russell’s paradox as well as
Russell’s pseudo-paradox of the village barber of Alcala who shaves all
and only those in the village who don’t shaves themselves in a theorem
known as <span class="smallcaps">Russell’s Law</span>.

T269 ~∃*y*∀*x*(R*xy* ↔ ~R*xx*)

For various interpretation of the relation R, we obtain a variety of
paradoxes. When R is interpreted as “*x* shaves *y*” we obtain the
Barber Paradox, when it is interpreted as “*x* ∈ *y*” we obtain
Russell’s paradox, and when it is interpreted as “*x* is true of *y*” we
obtain the heterological paradox.

We can even formulate a second-order version of Russell’s Law as
follows:

T275'    ~∃F\[F*y* ∧ ∀*x*(F*x *→ \[R*xy* ↔ ~R*xx*\])\]

This generalization proves the non-existence of any subset formed using
the Russell property and the *Aussorderungs* Axiom or Axiom of
Specification which treatz V as a second-order variable for a universal
derivation.

Paul Halmos in his classic *Naive Set Theory* (New York: Van Nostrand,
1960, pp. 6‐7) states the point of Russell’s paradox with flair:

> We have proved, in other words, that *nothing contains everything,*
> or, more spectacularly,
>
> *there is no universe* .
>
> “Universe” here is used in the sense of “universe of discourse,”
> meaning in any particular discussion, a set that contains all the

> To specify a set, it is not enough to pronounce some magic words
> (which may form a sentence such as “*x* ∉ *x*”): it is necessary also
> to have at hand a set to whose elements the magic words apply.

Halmos’s moral can be summarized in a theorem:

> T270 ∀*z*∃*y*∀*x*\[*x*∈*y*↔(*x*∈*z*∧*x*∉*x*)\] →  ∼ ∃*w*∀*x*(*x*∈*w*)

This theorem states that if for any set, there is a Russellian set
defined on that set, then there is no universal set.

An indirect disproof of the existence of a universal set V = {*x*| *x* =
*x* } is as follow. Suppose V exists, then y the *Aussorderungs* Axiom,
we have the set

R = {*x* ∈ V| *x* ∉ *x* } .

Then by the Axiom of Extensionality, we have that

∀*x* (*x* ∈ R ↔ *x* ∈ V ∧ *x* ∉ *x*) ,

from which we may derive Russell’s Paradox.

1\. *<s>Show</s>* V = <span class="smallcaps">{</span>*x*: *x* = *x*}

2\. V = <span class="smallcaps">{</span>*x*| *x* = *x* } exists Assume

12\. R ∈ R 11, Axiom of Specification

Almost every conceivable step of Russell’s paradox has been questioned.
Here is a representative list of five ways out of the contradiction.

1.  *Revising Syntax*: Russell’s Simple Theory of Types assigns types to
    all the terms of the language. It makes expressions of the form

*x* ∈ *x*

not grammatically well-formed unless the type of the variable on the
right is one higher than the type of the variable on the left:

*x<sub>n</sub>* ∈ *x<sub>n+1</sub>*

This restriction on the syntax makes it impossible to *formulate*
Russell’s paradox, but does it *explain* the paradox?

1.  *Revising Classical Logic*: Another tact is to cripple the logic.
    *Intuitionistic logic*, for example, restricts the structural rules
    of classical logic so that it is not possible to derive a
    contradiction using the two conditionals:

*x* ∈ *x* → *x* ∉ *x*

*x* ∉ *x* → *x* ∈ *x* .

This restriction on the logic of paradox makes it impossible to
*deducee* Russell’s paradox, but does it *explain* the paradox? Another
approach is to adopt a *relevance* logic in which a contradiction does
not imply everything and hence produces a *para-consistent logic*. Does
this approach satisfactorily explain away the paradox?

1.  *Revising Postulates*: The most commonly adopted strategy for
    avoiding contraction is to replace the unrestricted, or naïve,
    comprehension action with a restricted *Separation* or
    *Aussonderungs* Axiom:

> ∀*y* ∃*z* ∀*x* \[*x* ∈ *z* ↔ *x* ∈ *y* ∧ ϕ(*x*)\] .
>
> Given a previously existing set *y* and any first-order predicate
> expression ϕ(*x*) with the free variable *x*, we may “separate out” a
> subset *z* of *y* that consists of all and only those members *x* of
> *y* that satisfy ϕ(*x*). This approach requires specifying separate
> axioms for the existence of the empty set, a set of pairs, the union
> of set, etc.

1.  *Drawing a Distinction*: Related to the above strategy is the
    Cantorian or Gödel-Bernays-von-Neumann set theory, in which there is
    a dual conception of set that distinguishes *consistent* and
    *inconsistent* multiplicities (or, alternatively, distinguishes
    *sets* from *classes*). On the iterative conception of set, in
    contrast to the Fregean conception of a set as the extension of a
    predicate, sets are constructed in stages based on the power set
    operation applied to a set at the previous iteration. Intuitively,
    the inconsistent multiplicities are those collections that are “too
    big” to be set in the sense that they have members from arbitrarily
    high level or iterations.

2.  *Second-Order Arithmetic with Hume’s Principle*: In the 1970’s, the
    logician George Boolos and his students (i.e., Richard Heck)
    discovered that Frege’s inconsistent Basic Law V (which implied the
    unrestricted comprehension axioms) could be replaced with a weaker
    principle which states that the number of Fs is the same as the
    number of Gs if, and only if, the Fs can be put into one-to-one
    correspondence with the Gs.

(V*b*) ∀F∀G(#F = \#G ↔∀*x*(F*x* ↔ G*x*)) ,

which they called *Hume’s principle* insofar as Frege cited a passage
from Hume’s *Treatise* (Book I, Part III, Section I) in support of the
principle:

(HP) ∀F∀G(#F = \#G ↔ F ≈ G) .

It turns out that Hume’s principle is *consistent* assuming second
order-arithmetic is consistent and this principle is sufficient for the
derivation of arithmetic while avoiding the inconsistent Basic Law V.
They derive “Frege’s Theorem”, the vindication of a Fregean development
of arithmetic using Hume’s Principle.

This was a surprising, and deeply satisfying, reversal of Frege’s
honest, but noble, logicist despair. Although he did not live to see his
dream fulfilled, Frege was, in the end, vindicated by the history of
logic. Subsequent generations of logic students, inspired by Frege’s
visionary dream, eventually completed Frege’s life work by rigorously
providing the logicist foundations of arithmetic. Due to his logical
vision, Frege was forced to face the possibility that his life’s work
was nothing but a failed dream. ON the other hand, without such dreams,
no dream comes true.

In a subsequent chapter, we will return to Russell’s paradox and show it
can be discovered from the proof of Cantor’s theorem. We will discuss
the profound development of Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic set, and Gödel’s
philosophical justification of the axioms based on the Iterative Notion
of Cantorian Set Theory. We will address such questions as the
following:

-   What is the difference between Frege’s and Cantor’s conception of
    set? Is there a way to justify the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Skolem axioms
    for set theory as articulate a coherence conception of set?

-   Are questions such as Cantor’s Continuum Hypothesis about an
    objectively existing reality or is set theory the result of human
    construction?

-   What is Aczel Set Theory with the Anti-Foundation Axiom and why is
    it useful?

[3] At UCLA David Kaplan had proposed a project for an independent study
in which I formalized Frege’s *Grundgesetze*, which had been translated
by Montgomery Furth (1933 - 1991). All first-year students had to take a
four-hour Master’s Comprehensive Examination in Logic at the end of
their first year. This exam was a “washout” exam and even a graduate
student who had studied logic at U. C. Berkeley with Robert Vaught had
failed the exam. When it came time for my class to take the exam, I was
talking graduate courses in model theory from C. C. Chang, and so had
permission to arrive late. When I walked into the Philosophy Department
Reading Room, I saw the other graduate students in my cohort sweating
out the exam. Typically, there was always a question about Russell’s
paradox, and so I had toyed with the idea of reproducing Russell’s
paradox in Frege’s original notation. I came an hour late and left an
hour early.

[7] Today Frege is regarded, along with Bertrand Russell, as one of the
founding fathers of the analytic tradition in philosophy. Clark Glymour,
in *Thinking Things Through: An Introduction to Philosophical Issues and
Achievements* (MIT, 1992) pays tribute to Frege: “Despite the obscurity
of his writings during his lifetime, Frege’s efforts opened the way to
much of modern mathematics, modern logic, modern approaches to topics in
economics, and the modern theory of computation. Many people (including
me) think that most work of value in twentieth-century philosophy is in
some way indebted to Frege’s ideas…. Frege stands to logic roughly as
Newton stands to physics” (p. 120)*.*

[8] Gödel in “Russell’s Mathematical Logic” \[1947\] notes: “It is to be
regretted that this first comprehensive and thorough going presentation
of a mathematical logic and the derivation of Mathematics from it is so
greatly lacking in formal precision in the foundation (contained in
\*1 - \*21 of *Principia*), that it presents in this respect a
considerable step backwards as compared with Frege.” Reprinted in

[9] According to Greek mythology, Laelaps (Greek: Λαῖλαψ), the magical
hound who never failed to catch her prey, was a gift from Zeus to
Europe, and the Teumessian fox, the magical fox who was destined never
to be caught, was sent by Dionysus to prey upon the children of Thebes
as a punishment for the city’s crime. The Regent of Thebes Creon
assigned Amphitryon the seemingly impossible task of destroying the
Teumessian fox. Amphitryon decided to deploy Laelaps to catch Teumessian
fox. The endless chase went on until Zeus, perplexed by their
contradictory fates, decided to turn them both into stone and then cast
them into the heavens as the constellations *Canis Major* (Laelaps) and
*Canis Minor* (the Teumessian fox).

The origin of the Chinese word for contradiction originates in a puzzle
in the philosophical writings of Han Feizi (3rd century BCE) about a man
trying to sell a spear and shield. Touting the virtues of the spear, the
seller claimed it could pierce any shield, while touting the virtues of
the shield claimed it could fen off all spears. When he is asked what
would happen when the shield was struck by the spear, the seller had no
answer being caught in a self-contradiction. The Chinese word for
self-contradiction 矛盾, or in pinyin máodùn, literally means
"Spear-Shield."

[15] Anthony Kenny, *Frege: An Introduction to the Founder of Analytic
Philosophy* (Penguin Books, 1995), p. 207. Kenny’s heroic assessment of
Frege is tempered by Hilary Putnam’s sober comments in “Peirce the
Logician,” *Historia Mathematica* (1982. vol. 9, pp. 290-301, reprinted
in *Realism with a Human Face* (Harvard University Press: 1990), pp.
252-60) which register some resistance to Frege’s domineering role
compared to C. S. Peirce and Schröder in historical discussions of
logic:

“When I started to trace the later development of logic, the first thing
I did was to look at Schröder's *Vorlesungen über die Algebra der
Logik*, ...\[whose\] third volume is on the logic of relations (*Algebra
und Logik der Relative*, 1895). The three volumes immediately became the
best-known advanced logic text, and embody what any mathematician
interested in the study of logic should have known, or at least have
been acquainted with, in the 1890s.

“While, to my knowledge, no one except Frege ever published a single
paper in Frege's notation, many famous logicians adopted Peirce-Schröder
notation, and famous results and systems were published in it. Löwenheim
stated and proved the Löwenheim theorem (later reproved and strengthened
by Thoralf Skolem, whose name became attached to it together with
Löwenheim’s) in Peircian notation. In fact, there is no reference in
Löwenheim's paper to any logic other than Peirce's. To cite another
example, Zermelo presented his axioms for set theory in Peirce-Schröder
notation, and not, as one might have expected, in Russell-Whitehead
notation.

“One can sum up these simple facts (which anyone can quickly verify) as
follows: Frege certainly discovered the quantifier first (four years
before Oscar Howard Mitchell, going by publication dates, which are all
we have as far as I know). But Leif Ericson probably discovered America
“first” (forgive me for not counting the native Americans, who of course
really discovered it “first”). If the effective discoverer, from a
European point of view, is Christopher Columbus, that is because he
discovered it so that it stayed discovered (by Europeans, that is), so
that the discovery became known (by Europeans). Frege did “discover” the
quantifier in the sense of having the rightful claim to priority; but
Peirce and his students discovered it in the effective sense. The fact
is that until Russell appreciated what he had done, Frege was relatively
obscure, and it was Peirce who seems to have been known to the entire
world logical community. How many of the people who think that “Frege
invented logic” are aware of these facts?”
