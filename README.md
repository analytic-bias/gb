# To all collaborators who don't have TeXLive and Quarto<sup>1</sup>,

<sup>1</sup> Yes you need both as `TiKZ` is used extensively. Currently my working copy is still at [https://analytic-bias.github.io/agora/gb/](https://analytic-bias.github.io/agora/gb/).

Now you may commiting the files (by using `git` on your device or by using `GitHub Codespaces`), and go to the [Actions page](https://github.com/analytic-bias/gb/actions/workflows/exp.yml) to trigger a cloud compilation and deployment by clicking `Run workflow`.

After several minutes of waiting, you may go to [https://analytic-bias.github.io/gb/](https://analytic-bias.github.io/gb/) to view the result.
